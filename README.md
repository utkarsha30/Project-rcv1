# Developing a Multi-Label Classification Model Using the RCV1 Dataset for Accurate News Articles Classification 

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a multi-label classification model using the Reuters Corpus Volume I (RCV1) dataset for accurate classification of news articles. The dataset contains labeled news articles with multiple categories, making it suitable for multi-label classification tasks.

The project includes two main components:

1. **Google Colab Notebook (Cloud-Based) :**
   - File: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-SRh888IdL0QTw6x74N_SgQ82JnfQByT?usp=sharing
   - This notebook was run on Google Colab and focuses on models trained on a subset of 1,000 data samples. It is designed for ease of access and collaborative exploration.

2. **Jupyter Notebook (Local Machine):**
   - File: https://github.com/utkarsha30/Project-rcv1/blob/main/notebook2_10000samples.ipynb
   - This notebook was run locally and includes models trained on a subset of 10,000 data samples. It provides insights into model performance and analysis.

## Models Explored

The project explores the performance of the following models:

- Linear SVM
- Linear Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
